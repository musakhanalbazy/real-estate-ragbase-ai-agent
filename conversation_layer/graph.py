"""The LangGraph graph itself.

Shape (classic tool-calling loop, built explicitly with ToolNode instead
of a prebuilt helper, so it's easy to see/extend):

    START -> agent --(tool calls?)--> tools -> agent -> ... -> END
                 \\--(no tool calls)-----------------------> END

- "agent"  : one ChatOpenAI call, bound to TOOLS, with a system prompt
             built fresh from current state (system_prompt.py).
- "tools"  : LangGraph's ToolNode. Executes whichever tool(s) the model
             asked for (search_knowledge_base / save_lead_info /
             escalate_to_human) and appends their results as
             ToolMessages, then loops back to "agent".

Memory:
- Short-term (this conversation's messages) is handled entirely by the
  SqliteSaver checkpointer -- we never manually resend history.
- Long-term (name/phone/email/lead stage) is loaded from the CRM store
  into the initial state in run_turn(), and written back to it by the
  save_lead_info / escalate_to_human tools as the conversation goes.
