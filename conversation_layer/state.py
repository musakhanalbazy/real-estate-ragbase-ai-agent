"""The shape of data that flows through the LangGraph graph.

Every node reads from and/or writes to this state. LangGraph's
PostgresSaver checkpointer (memory/short_term_memory.py) persists this
whole object between turns, keyed by thread_id -- that's what gives the
agent memory without us re-sending history by hand.

Field names mirror lead_intelligence/lead_schema.py (the CRM record) so
mapping between "live conversation state" and "stored lead" stays 1:1.
