"""Tools available to the agent, run through LangGraph's ToolNode.

1. search_knowledge_base  -> customer support (RAG, always runs before
                              the model answers a property/company question)
2. save_lead_info         -> lead management. This is the "intelligent"
                              one: it auto-fills the phone number on
                              WhatsApp, validates email/phone format,
                              merges with what's already known, classifies
                              the lead stage using the exact rules from
                              company_data.py's "Lead Qualification
                              Questions" section, and tells the model
                              precisely what's still missing so it asks
                              for the right thing next -- instead of
                              re-asking for info it already has.
3. escalate_to_human      -> handoff to a human agent.
