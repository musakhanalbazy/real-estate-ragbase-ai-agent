"""Pydantic model for a Tanveer Associates real estate lead.

Field choices come straight from the "Lead Qualification Questions"

sales playbook (what to ask, in what order, and how leads get staged),
and this schema mirrors it so the data we store matches how the business
already thinks about a lead.
