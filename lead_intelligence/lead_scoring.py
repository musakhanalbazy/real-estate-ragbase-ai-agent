"""Lead classification for Tanveer Associates real estate leads.

This encodes the exact stage rules written into the knowledge base
itself (see the "Lead Qualification Questions" category in
knowledge_base/company_data.py), so the bot's sales logic and the
knowledge it can quote to a user always agree with each other:

    new                                 -> conversation just started
    ready_for_call_missing_contact_details -> budget confirmed, but
                                            missing required contact info
    qualified_missing_call_time         -> budget confirmed + contact
                                            complete, but no call time yet
    qualified_ready_for_call            -> budget confirmed + contact
                                            complete + call time set
    not_interested                      -> property interest expressed,
                                            but budget/financing unknown

Still rule-based (no extra LLM call) -- fast, free, and fully
predictable, which matters a lot for a CRM field that a sales team will
actually filter and sort by.
