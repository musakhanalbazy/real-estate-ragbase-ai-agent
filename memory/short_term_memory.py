"""Short-term (per-conversation) memory, backed by PostgreSQL.

LangGraph persists the *entire* graph state (messages + our custom
fields like lead stage) between calls, keyed by a "thread_id". As long
as we pass the same thread_id for the same user, the agent automatically
remembers the whole conversation -- we never manually re-send history.

Uses the same Postgres database as long_term_memory.py (a different set
of tables, created and managed by LangGraph itself via .setup()).
